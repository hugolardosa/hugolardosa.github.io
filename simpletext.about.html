<strong><h1>Hugo Leal</h1></strong>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm eager to learn and to acquire new skills, I’m motivated by solving problems and creating solutions. I have developed projects independently and for college, such as Python and Java efficient solutions, database projects, and web applications, among others. Recently, I have also developed an enthusiasm for making fast software and trying to push hardware to the limit.</p>
<p>In my free time, I'm passionate about retro computing (where I also try to use my software development skills) and music.</p>
<p>In the past, I've worked in a summer internship for the data science team at Farfetch, where I developed a plugin-based web application that allowed the creation of multiple types of tools to help validate datasets.
I've also worked in a research grant at Instituto de Telecomunicações, where I maintained and improved the distributed management system for the city’s data platform.</p>
Currently, I'm joining Squarespace as a software engenieer, and I'm thrilled for this new adventure.</p>
